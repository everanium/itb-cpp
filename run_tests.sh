# run_tests.sh -- Build and run every tests/test_*.cpp under
# bindings/cpp.
#
# Each tests/test_*.cpp is compiled to its own standalone executable
# in tests/build/, then run in turn. Per-process isolation gives every
# test a fresh libitb global state without needing an in-process
# serial lock. Binaries link libitb.so via embedded RPATH, so
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH is unnecessary at runtime.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_tests.sh
#
# Exit code is 0 when every test binary returns 0, 1 otherwise.
