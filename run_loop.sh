# Fleet entry point for the loop stress harness of the C++ binding:
# builds the utility with the binding's Makefile (a no-op when it is
# up to date; libitb3.so and the C++ library are assumed built by
# build.sh) and execs it with every argument passed through.
#
# The build output is captured rather than discarded: the compiler
# reports on stderr, and a redirect of stdout alone would let its
# lines join the utility's own output. Nothing is printed unless the
# build fails, in which case everything it said is.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_loop.sh --duration 2m --shape both
