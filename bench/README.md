# ITB C++ Binding — Easy Mode Benchmark

> **Security notice.** ITB is an experimental symmetric cipher construction without prior peer review, independent cryptanalysis, or formal certification. The construction's security properties have **not been verified** by independent cryptographers or mathematicians.
>
> PRF-grade hash functions are **required**. No warranty is provided.

**No bespoke cryptography.** ITB introduces no cryptographic primitive of its own — no custom S-box, permutation, or round function. It is a construction over existing primitives, much as PGP composes standard ciphers rather than defining one. Such constructions are not the object of algorithm-level cryptographic certification: national regimes (NIST CAVP/FIPS in the US, GOST/FSB in Russia, KCMVP in South Korea, OSCCA's SM-series in China, SOG-IS/EUCC and national lists in the EU, ASD's ISM in Australia) certify **primitives** and the **modules** built on them, not compositional schemes. Eligibility for regulated use is therefore inherited from the primitives ITB is configured with, not conferred by ITB itself.

Two executables (`bench_single`, `bench_triple`) cover the Easy Mode
encryption / decryption surface exposed by the C++ binding through the
C binding's static archive (`-litb_c -litb`):

* `bench_single.cpp` — Single Ouroboros (mode = 1, 3 seeds + optional
  dedicated lockSeed). Walks PRF-grade primitives plus one
  mixed-primitive variant.
* `bench_triple.cpp` — Triple Ouroboros (mode = 3, 7 seeds + optional
  dedicated lockSeed).

Both binaries pin **1024-bit ITB key width** and **16 MiB CSPRNG-filled
payload**, run four ops per case (`encrypt`, `decrypt`, `encrypt_auth`,
`decrypt_auth`), and emit a Go-bench-style line per case (`name iters
ns/op MB/s`).

The harness is a custom Go-bench-style runner in `common.hpp` (no
third-party bench framework — `<chrono>::steady_clock` and an inline
xorshift64* LCG cover the timing and random-fill surfaces). One
`make bench` invocation drives the whole compile.

## Prerequisites

Build the shared library and the C binding's static archive first (the
C++ binding consumes them at link time):

```bash
go build -trimpath -buildmode=c-shared \
    -o dist/linux-amd64/libitb.so ./cmd/cshared
cd bindings/c && make
cd ../cpp
```

A project-private opt-out tag is available when the 4-lane chain-absorb
wrapper is dead weight (hosts without AVX-512+VL). The tag disables
only the chain-absorb asm; upstream stdlib asm stays engaged so the
per-pixel single Func runs at upstream-asm speed via `process_cgo`'s
nil-`BatchHash` fallback:

```bash
go build -trimpath -tags=noitbasm -buildmode=c-shared \
    -o dist/linux-amd64/libitb.so ./cmd/cshared
```

The C++ binding links `libitb_c.a` plus `libitb.so` at compile time;
both must be in place before `make bench` succeeds. The Makefile's
`LDFLAGS` resolves `libitb_c.a` from `../c/build/` and `libitb.so` from
`../../dist/linux-amd64/` with `-Wl,-rpath` baked into the binary.

## Run

From the binding root (`bindings/cpp/`):

```bash
make bench
./bench/build/bench_single
./bench/build/bench_triple
```

Both binaries land in `bench/build/` after build. The four canonical
passes (Single ±LockSeed, Triple ±LockSeed) run via:

```bash
./run_bench.sh
```

which is the canonical entry point that fills [BENCH.md](BENCH.md).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ITB_NONCE_BITS` | `128` | Process-wide nonce width — `128`, `256`, or `512`. Maps to `itb::set_nonce_bits` before any encryptor is constructed. |
| `ITB_LOCKBATCH` | unset | Non-empty / non-`0` enables Lock Batch (performance Lock Soup mode); set with `ITB_LOCKSEED`. Every encryptor additionally calls `enc.set_lock_batch(1)`. Inert unless Lock Soup is engaged via `ITB_LOCKSEED`. |
| `ITB_LOCKSEED` | unset | When set to a non-empty / non-`0` value, every encryptor in the run calls `enc.set_lock_seed(1)`. Easy Mode auto-couples `set_bit_soup(1)` + `set_lock_soup(1)`, so no separate flags are needed. The mixed-primitive cases attach a dedicated lockSeed primitive (via `prim_l`) only under this flag; otherwise `prim_l` is empty so the no-LockSeed bench arm measures the plain mixed-primitive cost. |
| `ITB_BENCH_FILTER` | unset | Substring filter on bench-case names — only cases whose name contains the filter are run. Useful when iterating on one primitive / op. |
| `ITB_BENCH_MIN_SEC` | `5.0` | Minimum measured wall-clock seconds per case. The runner keeps doubling iteration count until the measured batch reaches the threshold, mirroring Go's `-benchtime=Ns`. The 5-second default absorbs the cold-cache / warm-up transient that distorts shorter measurement windows on the 16 MiB encrypt / decrypt path. |

Worker count is fixed at `itb::set_max_workers(0)` (auto-detect),
matching the cross-binding bench default.

## Examples

Whole grid, default settings (128-bit nonces, no lockSeed):

```bash
./bench/build/bench_single
```

512-bit nonces with the dedicated lockSeed channel + auto-coupled
overlay (the `ITB_LOCKBATCH=1` form selects the Lock Batch performance
variant of Lock Soup):

```bash
ITB_NONCE_BITS=512 ITB_LOCKSEED=1 ITB_LOCKBATCH=1 ./bench/build/bench_triple
ITB_NONCE_BITS=512 ITB_LOCKSEED=1 ./bench/build/bench_triple
```

Just the BLAKE3 row of the Single grid:

```bash
ITB_BENCH_FILTER=blake3_1024bit ./bench/build/bench_single
```

Only the encrypt-with-MAC ops across every primitive in the Triple
grid, with a longer 10-second per-case budget for tighter confidence
intervals:

```bash
ITB_BENCH_FILTER=encrypt_auth_16mb ITB_BENCH_MIN_SEC=10 \
    ./bench/build/bench_triple
```

Just the mixed-primitive cases on the Single side:

```bash
ITB_BENCH_FILTER=mixed ./bench/build/bench_single
```

## Output format

```
# easy_single primitives=9 key_bits=1024 mac=hmac-blake3 nonce_bits=128 lockseed=off workers=auto
# benchmarks=40 payload_bytes=16777216 min_seconds=5
bench_single_aescmac_1024bit_encrypt_16mb               64    493210110.0 ns/op    32.44 MB/s
bench_single_aescmac_1024bit_decrypt_16mb               64    488104225.0 ns/op    32.78 MB/s
...
```

The four columns are:

1. Bench-case name (snake-cased; `mixed` is the case appended
   after the primitive loop).
2. Iteration count chosen to reach `ITB_BENCH_MIN_SEC`.
3. Per-iter wall-clock cost in nanoseconds.
4. Throughput in MB/s, derived from `payload_bytes / ns_per_op`.

## Expected runtime

At the default `ITB_BENCH_MIN_SEC=5`, each pass walks 40 cases (
single-primitives + 1 mixed × 4 ops) and converges per case in 5-15
wall-clock seconds depending on the primitive's per-byte cost. A full
pass therefore lands at 5-10 minutes; the four canonical passes
(Single ±LockSeed, Triple ±LockSeed) fill BENCH.md in ~30 minutes of
total wall-clock time. Filter to a single primitive
(`ITB_BENCH_FILTER=blake3_1024bit`) for ~1-minute spot-check runs.

## Recorded results

A snapshot of the four canonical pass results (Single + Triple, each
with and without `ITB_LOCKSEED=1`) on Intel Core i7-11700K is collected
in [BENCH.md](BENCH.md). The same file briefly discusses the FFI
overhead the binding leaves on top of the native Go path through the
C binding's static archive.
